# Audilets

The Audilets is a kind of successor to the [Voicesmith](https://github.com/jurihock/voicesmith) project.
There is currently no specific product idea behind this, but the intention to rethink past things and discover new ones.

I think, the main focus should be on frequency domain processing according to the STFT.
Another interesting thing I found is the Stephan M. Bernsee technique described in
[Pitch Shifting Using The Fourier Transform](http://blogs.zynaptiq.com/bernsee/pitch-shifting-using-the-ft),
which could also be useful in general audio processing.

I have no plans to go back to the Android OS, but instead utilize the [RtAudio](https://github.com/thestk/rtaudio) interface to be more platform independent.
Otherwise the integration of development boards like [Teensy](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy) could be potentially a subject in case of concrete idea.
